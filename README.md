# Android_Malware_Detection
The proliferation of mobile devices has led to an increase in Android malware attacks in recent years, which raises serious security concerns. The hazards posed by this malicious software range from financial losses to illegal access to personal data. It is taking use of weaknesses in Android platforms. Thus, the need for trustworthy detection techniques is more and more important as atack frequency increases.
Because machine learning can identify intricate patterns in data and learn from large datasets, it is a promising approach to the detection of Android malware. This has caused an increase in the amount of research being done on machine-learning methods for malware detection. Nevertheless, in light of this increased interest, a thorough assessment is required to compile the body of knowledge and steer future research efforts.
In order to meet this need, the project provides an extensive analysis of machine learning-based methods for detecting malware on Android devices. Every part looks at the many machine learning methods that are used, the performance extents that are used, and the problems that come with the ways things are currently done. The study also suggests possible directions for further investigation to improve Android malware detection capabilities.
This project's mainly goal is to offer a thorough examination of Android malware detection based on machine learning. Through the examination of detection approaches, assessment of performance metrics, and identification of research gaps, the aim is to provide guidance and information for upcoming developments in this crucial area of cybersecurity.
